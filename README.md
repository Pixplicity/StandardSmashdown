Standard Smashdown
=================

This page contains the official specification for Standard Smashdown Ping-Pong (formerly Polish Roulette) as developed by Pixplicity et al.

In its popularity, we've seen that there has been increasing fragmentation in the rules of play, even new, non-standard additions to the rules. To restrict the gameplay to a base set of rules, we've introduced **Standard Smashdown**. With this set of formal specification and test suites, you can make sure you implement your gameplay according to spec!
